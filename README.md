# ICS4U0-EmployeeManagementSystem

This is the user guide to the Employee Management System I made for the ICS4U0 course. 

## The main window
Employee info is found in tables. There are 2 tabs, one for full time employees and one for part time employees, each with their own table. On the bottom there is a search bar and button, on the right side there are buttons for adding, removing, editting, and showing all employees. Profile pictures will also be found on the right side. 

## Saving, loading, importing and exporting
